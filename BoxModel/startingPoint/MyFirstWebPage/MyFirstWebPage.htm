				<h2>About</h2>				
				<p><img src="images/aboutImage.jpg" alt="SpiderPenguin out-stares a seal"/>Following an accident involving kelp, toxic waste, a nuclear submarine and a tasty tuna fish, mild-mannered Peter Penguin was transformed into the one and only SpiderPenguin - the world's first fish-powered superhero. Orcas quake and leopard seals quiver when this penguin goes for a swim.</p>
				<p>SpiderPenguin's powers include casting webs, climbing walls, and catching fish in the special spider-nets he fires from his super-flippers.</p>
				<p>Faster than a torpedo, stronger than a whale, and cooler than a cucumber, SpiderPenguin always saves the day</p>

					<h3>Rockhopper says 'Thanks SpiderPenguin!'</h3>					
					<p>A rockhopper had cause to say a big thank you to SpiderPenguin today: Whilst resting peacefully on a comfy iceberg, he was spotted by a pod of orcas who proceeded to take it in turns to try to wash him off the 'berg.</p>
					<p>'All seemed lost' said Rocky, but then in a flash of red and blue, and a flurry of sticky web-like material, SpiderPenguin swooped in and plucked Rocky to safety. Phew-ee!</p>
